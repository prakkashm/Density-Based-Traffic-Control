# Density-Based-Traffic-Control
This is a basic Arduino based project in which traffic lights at a fourway junction are controlled with respect to the traffic density at each of the four ways. It also has a Red light Violation Detector which sounds a buzzer if a person crosses a red light at any of the roads.
